# Introduction to Gitbook

**GitBook** is a modern static site generator that provides a way to write and share books online. With Gitbook, teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.  

## Gitbook V.S. LaTex Based Editors

While there are many available online LaTex based editors for collaborative documentation, such as [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com) and Google's [Docx2Latex](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/docx2latex/415272416461?pann=cwsdp&hl=en), we choose to use Gitbook because it offers easy version and access control. The most notable advantage aside from that is its flexibility of output formats. You can render to ePub, webpages, [PDF](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-pdf) etc. In comparison, LaTex based editors are relatively fixed to pdf. 

We have summarized Gitbook's distinctive features into the following points. The specific usage of each feature will be elaborated in the sections ahead.

* **Collaborate** **asynchronously** with your team comment and review drafts before publishing.
* **Version Control** by integrating with Github and creating backup for all the content you create.
* **Access control** by creating teams and assigning team members with different roles. 
* **Get** **shareable** **link** to allow non-Gitbook users to access your contents.
* **Embed rich contents** such as Youtube video, Github code, articles, etc.
* **Drop comments** on any section of the book.

Gitbook builds HTML web pages from static content in the form of raw data, such as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and predefined templates and themes. The HTML pages can then be hosted on a simple HTTP server.
