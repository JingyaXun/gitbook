# Introduction to Gitbook

**GitBook** is a modern static site generator that provides a way to write and share books online. With Gitbook, teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.  

While there are currently many available online editors for collaborative documentation, such as Overleaf and Google's Docx2Latex, we choose to use Gitbook because of it offers easier syntax and live-rendering. The most notable advantage aside from that is the flexibility of output formats. You can render to ePub, webpages, PDF etc. While LaTex based editors are relatively fixed to pdf. 

With Gitbook you can:

* **Collaborate** **asynchronously** with your team comment and review drafts before publishing.
* **Version Control** by integrating with Github and creating backup for all the content you create.
* **Access control** by creating teams and assigning team members with different roles. 
* **Get** **shareable** **link** to allow non-Gitbook users to access your contents.
* **Embed rich contents** such as Youtube video, Github code, articles, etc.
* **Drop comments** on any section of the book.

An bird view of Gitbook internal architecture:

Gitbook builds HTML web pages from static content in the form of raw data, such as markdown, and predefined templates and themes. The HTML pages can then be hosted on a simple HTTP server.
