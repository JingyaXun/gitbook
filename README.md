# Introduction to Gitbook

**GitBook** is a modern documentation platform where teams can document everything from products to internal knowledge-bases and APIs.

With Gitbook you can:

*  **Collaborate** **asynchronously** with your team comment and review drafts before publishing.
* **Get** **shareable** **link** to allow non-Gitbook users to access your contents.
* **Embed rich contents** such as Youtube video, Github code, articles, etc.
* **Access control** by creating teams and assigning team members with different roles. 
* **Drop comments** on any section of the book.
